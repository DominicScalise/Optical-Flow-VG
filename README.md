Pong with Hand Detection README

----- CREATORS -----

-----DESCRIPTION-----

This program simulates Pong, an old arcade game. It includes hand detection to start by detecting
a hand in the center region of the screen. It also uses skin tone detection to make the paddles
move when the player's hand is in the region of play. Additionally, it has a ball that starts in a
random location and begins moving when the game begins in a random direction at a random speed.
When the ball hits the  paddles, it changes its direction and when it hits the walls (and passes
the paddles), it ends the current game and increments the winning player's score.

---- TO RUN -----

To run this program, simply run the "webcam.py" file.
The dimensions of this game are set up for a 13-inch Mac Computer.
